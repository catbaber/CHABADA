This kind of musical serendipity is very specific to SoundCloud because of the platform’s unique content.” - TechCrunch, Alex Mozaed“The SoundCloud Go launch is a big move for the company, which built its business by allowing artists to upload their music and share it with fans on social media and blogs. Acts like Drake, Lily Allen, Kanye West and Miley Cyrus have used it to premiere songs, or share works in progress - even when they have a stake in rival streaming services, as West does with Tidal. It has established the Berlin-based company as an influential player in the music industry, especially in the dance music genre.” Mark Savage, COMMUNITY Like what you hear?
