Please ensure you have all your folders with music actually checked in Poweramp Settings =&gt; Folders and Library =&gt; Music Folders.Your original Android Library is not changed, nor any files deleted.Poweramp library is a separate, completely independent library. When you installed Poweramp 2.0, it just got filled with the files scanned from your sd card/other flash memory, as specified in Music Folders. Q. Volume too low.  Volume changes weirdly. Other volume issues.A. Try to disable Direct Volume Control in Poweramp Settings =&gt; Audio =&gt; Advanced Tweaks.Poweramp 2.x uses Direct Volume Control by default on 2.3+ mid-to-high end devices.
