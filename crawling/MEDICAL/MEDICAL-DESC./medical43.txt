Explain Medicine is a quick reference for medical professionals.If you are a practicing physician, the articles should provide a rapid refresher; if you are a student, you will very likely find them to be great for rapid revision.All facts are directly backed up by a citation to either a paper in a peer-reviewed journal, or a chapter in a standard textbook, so as to establish credibility, and facilitate further reading as necessary.Note:-------Explain Medicine is an ongoing and constantly evolving project; the 700+ articles currently available have been created by a team of over 100 doctors. If you are a medical professional yourself, and would like to join the team, please do take a look at http://www.explainmedicine.com/about.php
