There&#39;s more going on around you than you might realise.  It&#39;s time to hear it. HEADPHONES REQUIRED.  Failure to use headphones will result in awful audio feedback.  You have been warned!NOTE ON REVIEWS:  Please review the app if you try it.  But I know you hate leaving reviews . . . because I hate leaving reviews.  So, if you can think of nothing to say . . .just leave a review saying &quot;Rad&quot; if you love it or &quot;Bogus&quot; if you hate it.  Or, just say &quot;Eh&quot; if you have no opinion.  However, I love full and honest reviews as they really help us . . . but anything is good.  Now, back to what the app does . . . .Ear Spy is a &quot;Super Spy&quot; application which gives you super-hearing and the ability to eavesdrop on those around you.  With some bluetooth headsets, you can eavesdrop from the next room (tested with the Motorola HT820 Headset).Ear Spy amplifies sound coming through your phone microphone straight to your earphones.  To fine-tune the incoming signal, use the graphic audio equaliser.Perfect for the inquisitive spy within you.  But also perfect for those who are hard of hearing or suffer hearing loss (many people use it as a hearing aid).Upgrade to the pro version for some great added benefits:  --An extended Graphic Equaliser (more than 5 bands if your phone permits it)  --Echo Cancellation (AEC)  --Noise Suppression (NS)  --Virtualiser (Android 4.1 and above)  --Automatic Gain Control (AGC)  --Bass-Boost (Bass)  --MP3 Recording  --Home Screen Widget  --Ad-Free Spying!Learn more about Ear Spy by going to http://www.earspyapp.com/.
