What is Aadhaar?Aadhaar, which means &quot;foundation&quot; in many Indian languages, is the term for the unique identity number issued by the UIDAI. No resident can have a duplicate number since it is linked to their individual biometrics; thereby identifying fake and ghost identities which result in leakages today. Savings from eliminating duplicates and fakes through Aadhaar-based identification will further enable governments to expand benefits to other eligible residents.It is a 12 digit individual identification number issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India on behalf of the Government of India.This number will serve as a proof of identity and address, anywhere in India. Aadhaar letter received via India Post and e-Aadhaar downloaded from UIDAI website are equally valid.Features:- Instant Download/Update/Search.- Direct Download No Website Linking.- Check your Aadhaar status.- Update your Aadhaar Data.- Find your Aadhaar card.- Locate Enrollment Centre.- Book an appointment.
