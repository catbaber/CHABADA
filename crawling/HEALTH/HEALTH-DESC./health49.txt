We at BeatO work with the motto that our users are our no. 1 priority. Hence, we deeply reviewed each and every comment, held focus group sessions with active users and are now revealing the upgrade to our earlier version of BeatO. We hope you enjoy it as much as we have whilst working hard towards creating a great user experience for you. Do reach out to us to give your feedback as we continue our journey to evolve BeatO to what you need.Our new version contains several improvements in our features, UI and content. Here is a quick summary of what you will find inside:1) Education: We understood the need to support you in understanding diabetes, lifestyle changes it requires and complications that it may lead to. Hence, not only will you find articles written by real people who have had real experience with diabetes, but we welcome you to speak with BeatO’s trained diabetes educators to get any of your queries answered.	2) Diabetes Care at Home: Being a set of diabetics ourselves, we understand the need to provide convenient and affordable diabetes care. Hence, in Delhi/NCR, India, we have launched the BeatO care services. You can avail of these by simply booking them on the BeatO App, and we send our trained Diabetes Educators and Technicians to provide these services such as ECG, Diabetes Retinopathy, Diabetic Foot Exams and Diagnostic tests at the convenience of your home.  3) Data Logging: You can continue to use the easy interface that BeatO provides to log and manage your data. But now, in case you own a Fitbit, you can simply sync it with BeatO and your daily routine information gets automatically captured.4) Food Data: We have enhanced the food database not only in quantity and cuisines, but also by adding indicators to help you understand better what’s good and what’s not.
