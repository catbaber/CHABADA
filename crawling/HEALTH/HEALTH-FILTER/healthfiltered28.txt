Are trouble falling asleep? Are kids hyperactive playing tablet bed time?Are using smart phone tablet late evening? Twilight may solution you!Recent research suggests exposure blue light sleep may distort natural (circadian) rhythm cause inability fall asleep.The cause photoreceptor eyes, called Melanopsin. This receptor sensitive narrow band blue light 460-480nm range may suppress Melatonin production - hormone responsible healthy sleep-wake cycles.In experimental scientific studies shown average person reading tablet smart phone couple hours bed time may find sleep delayed hour.The Twilight app makes device screen adapt time day. It filters flux blue light emitted phone tablet sunset protects eyes soft pleasant red filter. The filter intensity smoothly adjusted sun cycle based local sunset sunrise times.Get Twilight1) Bed reading: Twilight pleasant eyes night reading. Especially able lower screen backlight far ability backligt controls screen2) AMOLED screens: We tested Twilight AMOLED screen 2.5 years without sign depletion over-burning. If properly configured Twilight causes less light emission (by enabling dimming) equal light distribution (dark areas screen status bar get tinted). This may fact increase AMOLED screen life time.Basics circadian rhythm role melatoninhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatoninhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanopsinhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythmshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm_disorderPermissions- location - find current sunset/surise times- running apps - stop Twilight selected apps- write settings - set back-light- network - access smartlight (Philips HUE) shield household light blueAutomation (Tasker other)https://sites.google.com/site/twilight4android/automationRelated scientific researchAmplitude Reduction Phase Shifts Melatonin, Cortisol Other Circadian Rhythms Gradual Advance Sleep Light Exposure Humans Derk-Jan Dijk, &amp; Co 2012Exposure Room Light Bedtime Suppresses Melatonin Onset Shortens Melatonin Duration Humans Joshua J.
